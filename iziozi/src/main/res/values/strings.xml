    <string name="tutorial_header_0">Welcome to IziOzi</string>
    <string name="tutorial_details1_0">This introduction will help you understand how to use this app and
        will only take a few minutes of your time.
        \n\nYou can navigate by swiping the pages from right to left. Let\'s begin.</string>

    <string name="tutorial_header_1">Add pictograms in edit mode</string>
    <string name="tutorial_details1_1">At the first run of the app \"edit mode\" will be activated and you
        will be presented with 6 pictograms. This is called a "board".
        \n\nYou can start editing by tapping on a pictogram.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_details2_1">From the plus buttons you can add another board. The trashbin
        deletes the current board you are on.</string>

    <string name="tutorial_header_2">Set a new image</string>
    <string name="tutorial_details1_2">Tapping on a pictogram will show you a set of options. Setting
        this pictogram as a tree board means adding a board inside it, such that when you click on that
        pictogram, a new board will be displayed.
        \n\nYou can also delete and set an image.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_header_3">Set the pictogram information</string>
    <string name="tutorial_details1_3">After choosing to set an image you can tap on the current empty
        box to select a source for the picture.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_details2_3">You should also set the title and optionally the text to be spoken.
        \n\nInstead of the text to be spoken you can register a sound by pressing the record button. Click
        the save icon when you\'re done.</string>

    <string name="tutorial_header_4">Choose a pictogram source</string>
    <string name="tutorial_details1_4">You have a couple of options to choose your pictograms from.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_details2_4">Selecting to search from the database will position the cursor
        at the top and you can start typing. Let\'s search for the word \"bus\".
        \n\nPress enter when finished to start searching.</string>

    <string name="tutorial_header_5">Database search results</string>
    <string name="tutorial_details1_5">The search results will display a list of pictograms which you
        can scroll through until you find the one you like. Select one by tapping on it. This will
        cause the app to download the image and display it on the preview section.
        \n\nIt will also complete the title field with the title of the image you selected.</string>

    <string name="tutorial_header_6">The main menu</string>
    <string name="tutorial_details1_6">You can enter the main menu by tapping on the three dots in the
        top-right corner. This will present you with all the options available.
        \n\nThe option \"manage boards\" lets you save, load and create a new board. When saving you can use
        \"save as\" to give your board a name. The name will appear when you will load a new board.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorial_details2_6">The \"Lock\" option locks the screen and hides the options menu and
        the system bar. Doing so prevents others from accessing the menu and making changes.
        \n\nTo exit the lock mode position your finger at the top of the screen and swipe down and select
        unlock.
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_header_7">Change the settings of the board</string>
    <string name="tutorial_details1_7">The settings menu allows you to make changes to your board
        configuration. More pictograms can be displayed by selecting the number of rows and columns.
        \n\nFinally, you can disallow swipe movements from one board to the other and instead use the
        navigational arrows. This is available if you have more than one board.</string>
